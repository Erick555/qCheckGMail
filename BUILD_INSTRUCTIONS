The build system in use is cmake

To build make sure you have the following packages installed(packages may be named differently in your distribution):

A C compiler
A C++ compiler
cmake
Qt5-devel( or whatever its called in your distribution )
libgcrypt-devel

To build WITH KDE support(kwallet integration and kde tray icon functionality),run the following commands from the source folder

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
make install

Note:
The last command must be run from root's account and depending on your distribution,you may need to run one of below two:
su -c "make install"
sudo make install

To build WITHOUT KWALLET support,add "-DNOKDESUPPORT=true" option.

To build WITHOUT libsecret support,add "-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=true" option.

To build WITH KF5's KStatusNotifierItem support,add "-DKF5=true" option

Possible build issues:
Problem:
linking failed because a library could not be found.

Possible reason,expected library could not be found because either they are not installed or they are but they are placed in a non
standard location.

Solution0:
File a bug report with your distribution and ask for developments files to be in standard directories where they can easily be found.

Solution1:
Find the location of the library that could not be found and add its full path to CMakeLists.txt file in the "TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES" line
